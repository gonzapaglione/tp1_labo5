                        <p><b>A full-color introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS from the publishers of
                                Wrox!</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the
                            professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a
                            little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store)
                            and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching
                            HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers,
                            which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to
                                everyone―hobbyists, students, and professionals―and it’s full-color throughout</li>
                            <li>Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a
                                simple way that is engaging</li>
                            <li>Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from
                                beginning to end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back
                            to. It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple,
                            attractive and engaging way!

                        <h2> Revision del libro</h2>
                        <p>The book went completely through all the HTML it included (page structure, text, lists,
                            links, images, tables, forms, audio and video and a few other bits of HTML) before
                            getting to any CSS. Normally that would bother me, but it worked in this book. The
                            CSS part of the book included color, text, boxes, lists, tables, forms, layout, images and
                            some info on layout using HTML5.
                        </p>
                        <p>Where the book is a little out of date is the information about HTML5. It’s no fault of
                            the author, it’s just that the book came out in 2011. A few things are included
                            (like hgroup or codec issues with video elements) that have gone away, and a few things
                            that are more recent (like the main element) didn’t get mentioned. I reduced the star
                            rating on the book because of that, but if I’d seen the book and reviewed it 4 years ago, I
                            would have given it 5 stars. I simply want anyone who buys and uses it now to be aware
                            that small parts of the book in the HTML 5 descriptions are different now. The book is
                            still a perfectly good way to learn HTML and CSS – in fact, the book is an excellent
                            way to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
